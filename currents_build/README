# % 'exoShape' is a derived software by Stanley Durrleman, Copyright (C) INRIA (Asclepios team), All Rights Reserved, 2006-2009, version 1.0

# ------------------------------
# INSTALATION
# ------------------------------

The core of the registration algorithm is coded in MATLAB(R) and can be run on MATLAB(R) version 7.1 or higher. Optimization routines are coded as mex-files and therefore must be compiled. Optimization based on FFTs must be linked with fftw3 library distributed under the GNU GPL license at www.fftw.org.


In Matlab, compile projConvol.cpp, convol.c and gridOptim.c as follows

mex file.c -lfftw3 -Linstall_dir/lib -Iinstall_dir/include

i.e.

mex convol.c libfftw3.a -I"./"

mex convol.c /Users/catalina/code/fftw/bin/lib/libfftw3.a -I/Users/catalina/code/fftw/bin/include

# ------------------------------
# TEST
# ------------------------------

run this command line to test the compilation:

match2vtks('./test/source.vtk','./test/target.vtk','./test/output','1','0.0001')

(should take about 15 mins to run)

check in Paraview that the 'output.vtk' and 'expected_output.vtk' look the same

# ------------------------------
# BUILDING NOTES
# ------------------------------

* set up your mex compiler in MATLAB (look online for any compatibility issues or patches for your OS - MATLAB version)

* for the FFTW library: I've included pre-compiled fftw library for Mac OS X and windows. You can test if this works in your computer by tying this in the MATLAB console.

mex convol.c libfftw3.a -I"./"

If this doesn't work, you would have to install FFTW yourself (www.fttw.org).

Figure out where the library and include files are:

ie.
/Users/username/code/fftw/bin/lib/libfftw3.a
/Users/username/code/fftw/bin/include/fftw3.h

and

compile the mex files using either of these command lines

mex file.c /Users/username/code/fftw/bin/lib/libfftw3.a -I/Users/username/code/fftw/bin/include

mex file.c -lfftw3 -L/Users/username/code/fftw/bin/lib/ -I/Users/username/code/fftw/bin/include/
